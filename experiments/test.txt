The Test

In the silence of the room, the clock ticks loud,
A single sheet of paper, a heavy shroud.
Questions stare, demanding all I know,
My mind races, the answers seem to slow.

The test, a measure of what's in my mind,
But the stress it brings, so unkind,
A single mark, a judgment cast,
But does it truly define my vast?

I scribble words, and hope they're right,
The weight of it all, an endless fight.
But tests, they teach, resilience and grit,
To rise again, when we feel unfit.

So I'll face the challenge, with all my might,
For in this moment, I'll take flight.
Beyond the scores, beyond the measure,
I'll find my strength, my hidden treasure.

For tests are but a fleeting phase,
In the grand symphony of life's maze.
I'll give my all, and do my best,
For in the end, I'll pass the test.

This spoken poetry reflects the emotional journey of facing a test, highlighting the pressure, resilience, and the realization that tests are just a part of life's larger picture.
