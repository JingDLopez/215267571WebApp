                    <strong>Early Years</strong> <br> My sister is the second child in the family, born 4 years after
                    our eldest brother. I call her "Ate Ei" (Older Sister Ei in English). When Ate Ei entered elementary
                    school at our hometown, she was considered a genius. She is the validectorian on every year level
                    she went on, bringing pride and honor to the family, which continued until high school. She always
                    bagged the top ranking at school, the Editor-in-Chief of the school newspaper, and the
                    representative of the school on most intellectual competitions.

                    <strong>College Life</strong> <br> When I was born and gained consicousness, she had
                    already went to college. Thankfully, she doesn't have to rent alone since she is with my dad, who
                    works as a taxi driver in the city. Our parents' savings are just enough to keep us by on our daily
                    needs so my sister had to apply to multiple scholarships. She is also a consistent Dean's Lister
                    (which awards them with tuition discounts), and also works summer jobs during vacation. She
                    graduated top 1 in the whole college of accountancy in the university (UC), achieving yet another
                    milestone.

                    6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major
