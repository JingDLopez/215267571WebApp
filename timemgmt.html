        more critical responsibilities.
    </p><br><br>


    <h2>7. TAKE BREAKS </h2>
    <p>Regular breaks prevent burnout and improve overall productivity.
        <br><br>Schedule short breaks to <b> recharge your mind </b>.
    </p><br><br>


    <h2>8. SET DEADLINES </h2>

        encourages timely completion and avoids procrastination.
    </p><br><br>


    <h2>9. LEARN TO SAY NO </h2>
    <p>It's essential to <b> recognize your limits </b>. <br><br> Politely decline additional
        tasks when your schedule is already full to avoid overcommitting.
