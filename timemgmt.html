        Define your <b><u>short-term and long-term</u></b> goals. <br><br>Having a clear 
            direction will guide your tasks and help prioritize your time.</p><br>

    <p> <h2>2.  PRIORITIZE TASKS  </h2>
          <b><u>Not</u></b> all tasks are equal. <br><br> Identify the most important ones and focus
            on completing them first. This ensures that you <b><u>address high-priority</u></b>
            items promplty.</p><br>

    <p> <h2>3.  CREATE A TO-DO LIST </h2>
        List your tasks for the day, week, or month. <br><br> A to-do list provides a 
            <b><u>visual overview</u></b> and helps you stay organized and on track.</p><br><br>
    
    <p> <h2>4.  USE TIME BLOCKS  </h2>
        Divide your day into time blocks and assign specific tasks to each block.
            <br><br>This helps maintain focus and <b><u>prevents multitasking</u></b>.</p><br><br>
    
    <p> <h2>5.  ELIMINATE DISTRACTIONS  </h2>
        Identify and minimize distractions in your workspace. <br><br> Turn off notifications
            and create a <b><u>conducive environment for concentration</u></b>.</p><br><br>
    
    <p> <h2>6.  LEARN TO  DELEGATE   </h2>
        Don't hesitate to delegate tasks when possible. This <b><u>frees up your time</u></b> for
            more critical responsibilities.</p><br><br>
    
    <p> <h2>7.  TAKE BREAKS   </h2>
        Regular breaks prevent burnout and improve overall productivity. 
            <br><br>Schedule short breaks to <b><u>recharge your mind</u></b>.</p><br><br>

    <p> <h2>8.  SET DEADLINES   </h2>
        Assign deadlines to your tasks to create a <b><u>sense of urgency</u></b>. <br><br> This 
            encourages timely completion and avoids procrastination.</p><br><br>
    
    <p> <h2>9.  LEARN TO SAY NO   </h2>
        It's essential to <b><u>recognize your limits</u></b>. <br><br> Politely decline additional
            tasks when your schedule is already full to avoid overcommitting.</p><br><br>

    <p> <h2>10.  REFLECT AND ADJUST   </h2>
        <b><u>Regularly assess</u></b> your time management strategies. <br><br> If certain methods 
            aren't working, be open to adjusting your approach for better results.</p><br><br>
